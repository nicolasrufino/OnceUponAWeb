            Thrasher ain't just a magazine; it is a manifesto.
            The 90s were chaotic, colorful, and filled with skateboarding tricks.
            Skate culture screamed, “Be bold, be wild, be yourself.”
            Identity wasn’t overthought—it was just lived. Wear what you want, skate where
            you want, and never apologize. People were never afraid to be themselves.
            Sometimes I wish I was born in the 90s.

          The 90s showed us that identity isn’t set — but created.
          It was a time of baggy jeans, white t-shirts with colorful designs, and crazy hats.
          Color was a REALLY important factor too, as people would try different colors together.
          As a kid I’ve always loved the 90s, the way people would act and dress seemed free.
          Life’s too short to blend in and to be afraid.
          It’s time to grab your board, throw on some JNCO’s and remember that being loud and messy is how you
          can finally find your freedom.

            This culture has been a part of me since I was a kid (the green one in the picture).
            The biggest inflence was my mother, as she would dress me with bold colors and patterns.
            Even though she wasn't a skater, her style was very similar to the 90s skater style.
            And I am glad she shared it with me. She has influenced a big part of my identity.

          Over time I've developed this style and made it my own.
          I've always been a fan of the 90s skater style, and I've always wanted to be a part of it.
          Just like my mom, I wanted to share it with someone, and I did.
          In the picture you can see my little brother, who anythime I have a chance I introduce him to the style and the culture.
