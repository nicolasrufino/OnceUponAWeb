                <p>The Rick Owens’ Kiss Heel is a rebellion. It is not only chunky and bold, but also defies the
                    societal norms dictating that only women can use heels. It’s not just a shoe—it’s a statement:
                    identity isn’t about rules, it’s about breaking them. Rick Owens wears this shoe constantly to
                    combat social standards.
                    Wear whatever pleases you. </p>

                <p> Rick Owens is a provocateur. Inspired by punk, his designs are a middle finger to conformity and
                    social standards . He doesn’t care about trends—he cares about substance. His message? Identity
                    isn’t given—it’s taken. Be you. A perfect example of this is when he dropped out of college. Why did
                    he drop out? He realized that fashion was being taught as a fixed concept, and he decided to follow
                    his own path. A true architect of identity. </p>

                <h3 class="rick-title-text">Wear Your Rebellion</h3>
                <p>Rick Owens designs are unique. He doesn’t need color to express himself. Monochromatic, audacious and
                    innovative, scream POWER. Fashion isn’t just what you wear — but who you are. Own it. Own your
                    Identity. Find it. Don’t be afraid. No-one else can be you for you.</p>
