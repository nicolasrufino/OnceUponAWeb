                <p> I like the Rick Owens’ Kiss Heel; it makes me a rebel. <br>
                    It is chunky, bold and fights social norms.  <br>
                    Heels are only for women they say.  <br>
                    To them I say, 'Rick Owens Kiss Heel'.  <br>
                    Identity has no rules, break them if you have to. <br>
                    I have become this shoe.  <br>
                    Everyday I grow more tired about what people think about me.  <br>
                    About us all.  <br>
                    About what we do, why we do it, who we are. <br>
                    I want to be me, let me fucking be me.   <br>
                    I am this shoe.  <br>
                    I am 'Rick Owens Kiss Heels'. </p>

                <!-- Rick Owens is an inspiration.  <br>
                    His designs derive from punk.  <br>
                    Which is why his designs are a middle finger to conformity and social standards. <br>
                    He doesnt care about trends, but substance. <br>
                    In life I have learned that identity isnt given, its taken. <br>

                <p>
                    Rick Owens designs are unique. <br>
                    In contrast to previous page, he doesn’t need color to express himself. <br>
                    Monochromatic, audacious andinnovative, scream POWER. <br>
                    Be powerful by being you. <br>
                    Fashion isn’t just what you wear — but who you are. <br>
                    Wear what you are, wear your rebellion. <br>
                    No-one else can be you for you.</p>
