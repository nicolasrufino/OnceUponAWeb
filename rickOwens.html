              <p>
                  I like the Rick Owens’ Kiss Heel; it makes me a rebel. <br>
                  It is chunky, bold and fights social norms. <br>
                  Heels are only for women they say. <br>
                  To them I say, 'Rick Owens Kiss Heel'. <br>
                  Identity has no rules, break them if you have to. <br>
                  I have become this shoe. <br>
                  Everyday I grow more tired about what people think about me. <br>
                  About us all. <br>
                  About what we do, why we do it, who we are. <br>
                  I want to be me, let me fucking be me. <br>
                  I am this shoe. <br>
                  I am 'Rick Owens Kiss Heels'.

              <p>
                  Rick Owens is an inspiration to me. <br>
                  His designs derive from punk. <br>
                  Which is why his designs are a middle finger to conformity and social standards. <br>
                  He doesnt care about trends, but substance. <br>
                  Owens has had a big influence on how I think and view the world. <br>
                  He is able to deliver this message through visuals and clothing. <br>
                  In life I have learned that identity isnt given, its taken.

              <p>
                  Rick Owens designs are unique. <br>
                  In contrast to previous page, he doesn’t need color to express himself. <br>
                  Monochromatic, audacious and innovative, scream POWER. <br>
                  Be powerful by being you. <br>
                  Fashion isn’t just what you wear — but who you are. <br>
                  Wear what you are, wear your rebellion. <br>
                  No-one else can be you for you.

              <p>
                  This journey began with a single pair of boots. <br>
                  Inspired by Rick Owens’ Kiss Heels, I stepped outside my comfort zone. <br>
                  I had always gravitated toward colorful sneakers, but his dark, punk aesthetic drew me in. <br>
                  At first, I hesitated—where I come from, such drastic style changes are rare. <br>
                  But the moment I put them on, I felt like a new version of myself. <br>
                  I loved everything—the high heel, the chunky gothic look, the bold statement. <br>
                  With these boots, I took a step into a new world—and I haven’t looked back.

              <p>
                  After that first step, the next ones came naturally. <br>
                  The boots felt like a part of me—like they had always been there. <br>
                  I wore them everywhere, with everything. <br>
                  I experimented with new accessories, new aesthetics. <br>
                  With each choice, I felt more confident, more powerful. <br>
                  I felt like me. <br>
                  I felt like Rick Owens.

              <p>
                  This journey led me to share it with close friends <br>
                  Those who embodied rebellion and embraced the unconventional. <br>
                  People that were not afraid to be different, to be unique, to be themselves. <br>
                  People that would cut, sew, and paint as a form of expression. <br>
                  Now, I thrive in this environment, where I can be myself, where I can be unique, where I can be me.
